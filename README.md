simbool
=======

A sound, fast and incomplete boolean expression simplifier.
This is *not* based on the Quine-McCluskey algorithm.

	True	

	# Proving transitivity of implication
	>> P = ((A > B) & (B > C)) > (A > C)

	True
	
	# Simplify some expression
	>> simplify(~A | (C & (~(B & ~C) | A)))
	~A | C
